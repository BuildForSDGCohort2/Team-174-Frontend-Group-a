# Application Name â€“ ConnectR
### Software as a Service Application 
In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has had to reorganize its transport infrastructure to address the required social distancing guidelines. As a result different transport providers have turned to ICT to help manage the new economy within the pandemic. As a result we have developed a SaaS where different Matatu(PSVs in Kenya) Saccos can simply create an account and access different utilities on demand to manage their logistics. 
## Application Summary
ConnectR is a web application that will enable users to manage billing and ticketing of passenger as well as goods. The application will enable a Matatu Sacco to create an account, list the type of vehicles available, the different routes that take, different stops, charges, load capacity allowed per passenger, cost of transporting goods among others. The users should then have a summary of available vehicles, loads on transport and the overall billing cycles. 
## Project Vision
The application should be a universal application that can be used by any logistics company including but not limited to, Matatu(Kenya Public Service Vehicles) business for booking and managing passengers, Indoor Production Warehouse, Transits hubs warehouse, Warehouse for rent and many more
